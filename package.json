Kubernetes is an\nopen-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of\ncontainerized applications. \n\nAmazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so\nyou can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community.\nApplications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications\nrunning on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises\ndata centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any\nstandard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification\nrequired.",
